# Paypal and Stripe nodejs integration

Paypal can accept payment from both the client side as well as backend. When you don't what the client or bad actors to have controls over how much they pay, the payment should be handled on the back end.

For a case where it is a donation payment, impkementing paypal on the client side is sufficient.
